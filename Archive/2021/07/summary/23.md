# MCL-GAN: Generative Adversarial Networks with Multiple Specialized Discriminators
### (Jinyoung Choi and Bohyung Han, SNU) - NeurIPS submission
#### Summarized by Woohyeon Sim

* Task: Training GANs with multiple discriminators that are specialized to the different subsets of the datasets.
* Main novelty: updating rule of multiple discriminators based on multiple choice learning (MCL).
* Multiple Choice Learning:
	* Discriminators are modeled with different fc layers at the last level.	
	* k discriminators with the smallest errors are assigned to each sample as expert models and each expert is trained with standard GAN loss.
		
	* Non-expert models are trained to have lower accuracies than the expert models (e.g., these models predict the real sample by uniform distribution [0.5, 0.5]).	
	* Real samples are assigned evenly over experts by forcing averaged probability distribution over them to be uniformly-distributed. But this may result in non-optimal clustering, so they gradually decarease the weight of this balancing loss.
* The experiments are conducted on various tasks, but only with small sets and architecture.

**총평**: MCL과 엮은 것이 흥미롭긴 했지만 구현 상의 노벨티와 성능 게인이 거의 없음. 실험도 옛날 17년도 논문(GMAN)과의 비교가 주를 이룸. GMAN과의 비교분석도 명료하지 않은데, GMAN보다 좋은 이유를 discriminator가 strong correlated되있지만 제안한 것은 sample마다 specialized된 discriminator가 있어 그렇다고 함. 그 다음 논문 읽기에서 이를 살펴보겠음.
