**Task**: Gaze Estimation (Predicting Pitch & Yaw angles of gaze)
Main novelties: "Weak Supervision"  + "Physically Unconstrained"
 
**Weak supervision**: Using social relationships label "Looking at each other" (LAEO)

* two people looking at each other
	
* Their gaze directions are opposites to each other
	
* Labelling as "LAEO" is much simpler and cheaper than complex 3D gaze estimation annotations

**Physically unconstrained**:

* Previous approaches (weaksup was not widely used in this field) mainly focused on cases where camera was frontal to the faces, and the gazes faced more or less towards the camera
	
* With LAEO labels, the heads of people could be anywhere, and in extreme cases only one face can be seen (other face occluded by back of head) - therefore the head positions and gaze directions are more physically unconstrained compared to previous approaches

**Overall Architecture**:
ResNet18 feature backbone + LSTM + FC Layer -> Regress 1) gaze directions 2) Uncertainty
The LSTM is omitted when processing a single image
 
Main contributions: Loss functions
Preliminary) Scene Geometry Estimation
Uses 2D-3D correspondence (DensePose), predicted 2D facial keypoints (ICCV 2017)  + 3D SMPL model to recover depth z of each head
--> Ends up with a shared 3D coordinate system for each subjects under LAEO
 
1) Geometric 2D LAEO Loss:
@Projection of predicted 3D gaze vectors should lie along the same line joining their 2D cyclopedian eyes(middle of eyes)
2) Geometric 3D LAEO Loss : 
@ The estimated 3D gaze vector originating from person A should intersect that eye of B (and vice versa)
3) Pseudo Gaze LAEO Loss
@ The 3D gaze vectors of two individuals A and B are direct opposite directions to each other 
4) Aleatoric Gaze Loss
@ Models the distribution of estimated gaze angles as Parametric Laplacian function, minimize the negative log likelihood of obersving the GT ttruth gaze value w.r.t the laplacian distribution
5) Symmetry Loss
@ Gaze estimation has left-right symmetry i.e. if the image is flipped horizontally, only the yaw angle of the gaze is reversed (+ -> -).
@ Use reversed yaw angle to pseudo-supervise "horizontally flipped) images
 
Weak supervision alone CAN predict the gaze, but worse than fully-supervised work
Achieves much better results with Semi-supervision (Full supervision + LAEO supervision proposed in the paper)
 
총평) 
* 전반적인 pipeline의 구성들이 아주 잘 나열되어있어서, citation을 따라가기 편하게 되어있습니다. Gaze estimation에 입문하는 사람에게도 전반적인 연구의 흐름과 모델/loss 구성을 파악하기 쉬운 논문인 것 같습니다.
* "Annotation이 scale하기 어려운 경우"의 weak supervision을 아주 잘 적용한 케이스입니다. 그 과정에서는 off-the-shelf 방법들을 많이 사용하지만 (2D Facial landmark detection 등), 그 formulation이 novel하여 oral을 받은 게 아닐까 생각됩니다.
